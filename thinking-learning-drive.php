                <h2 class="fw-bold  mb-3">Things to think about before learning to drive</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Learning to drive is probably one of the most useful and important
                  skills most of us
                  learn in life. Millions of people take to the streets with their driving instructors
                  each year, building up their experience so that they can finally pass their test and
                  take to the roads on their own. It involves a good deal of time, effort and money to
                  learn to drive, however, and finding a good instructor is often half the battle.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">But before you decide to start learning, here are few things that you
                  need to take into
                  account:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>First and foremost, of course, you need to be over the age of 17 and have a
                    provisional
                    licence. No driving instructor will be able to take you on if you don't have
                    this bit of
                    paperwork sorted out. The good news is that you can apply for your provisional
                    licence
                    online.</li>
                  <li>You also need to have decent eyesight; that means you should be able to read a
                    car
                    licence plate that is situated 20 metres away.</li>
                  <li>Most people employ a qualified driving instructor to help them to learn to
                    drive. If you
                    are being tutored by a friend or family member, they need to be over the age of
                    21 and
                    have at least 3 years or more driving experience.</li>
                  <li>Any car that you are learning in needs to display clear L plates so that other
                    drivers
                    can see. You should, of course, make sure that the car has a valid MOT and the
                    tax is up
                    to date.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Thinking About Driving</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">There are numerous qualities you need to bring to the process of
                  driving. This includes
                  being diligent and focused on your lesson, making sure, for example, that you pay
                  attention to the traffic around you and understanding that you have to show patience
                  and
                  be conscious of other road users including pedestrians at all times.</p>

                <h3>Choosing the Right Driving Instructor</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">There are plenty of driving instructors to choose from, especially if
                  you live in a big
                  city. It pays to shop around and find one that is best suited to your temperament
                  and
                  needs. A bad instructor can make you lose confidence and give you such a poor
                  experience
                  that it turns you off driving. Remember that you are a consumer and you have a right
                  to
                  change if you are not satisfied.</p>
                <h3>Driving Instructor</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">One of the key areas that is going to impact on you is the cost of
                  driving lessons. Only
                  a qualified driving instructor or a trainee driving instructor can charge you for
                  these
                  lessons. If you are not sure about their qualification you can ask to see their
                  Driver
                  and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) badge. This should be clearly displayed in the
                  car.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Cost is a factor that leads many people to get extra lessons from a
                  friend or family
                  member. This is fine as long as they meet the qualification requirements. Using a
                  qualified instructor is, however, the best way to ensure that you get the right
                  training
                  and cover all the points you need to pass your test when the time comes.</p>
