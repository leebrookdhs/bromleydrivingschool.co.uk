                            <p class="mb-4">For most people turning seventeen means one thing; learning to drive. For not for
                                everyone and there are many people who, for one reason or another, do not feel that urge. They hit
                                their twenties and still never get around to learning to drive. Then they reach their thirties and
                                the irritation with public transport reaches fever pitch or the person they relied on to drive for
                                them cannot do it anymore. So they start looking for a driving instructor. But is it harder to learn
                                to drive in your thirties?</p>
                            <h3>The positives</h3>
                            <p class="mb-4">For many people, starting to learn to drive in their thirties may seem unimaginably
                                hard when they have driven since they were eighteen. But there are some clear advantages that older
                                learner drivers have that the younger ones do not.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">For starters, you have years of accumulated road knowledge, whether you thought you
                                were paying attention or not. Drivers have a habit of telling non-drivers what another driver did
                                wrong, why they were in the wrong lane or what that wacky signpost really means. And you do take
                                information in. This means when you come to put it into practice, it can be surprising how much road
                                etiquette and knowledge you have already amassed. As opposed to a seventeen-year-old who was likely
                                playing with their smartphone most of the time while driving and has no idea!</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">Insurance is cheaper as a learner in your thirties and this often means you can be
                                added to someones policy to get practice without needed to remortgage the house as you do when you
                                are in your teens. More practise is always good away from your driving lessons and obviously, costs
                                less too.</p>
                            <h3>Awareness and confidence</h3>
                            <p class="mb-4">Awareness of consequences and self-confidence are two areas that can go either way for
                                thirties learner drivers. Because you realise that you could kill someone through your driving, hit
                                a kid on a bike or crash into some pedestrians, you have a natural caution that kids often lack.
                                This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your personality.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">The same applies to self-confidence. Teens think they are indestructible and often
                                drive like that. Older drivers know they are not and this can make them more cautious but again,
                                this can be a good thing. As long as it does not become a paralysing caution that causes them to
                                doubt themselves.</p>
                            <h3>The negatives</h3>
                            <p class="mb-4">Both the above can become negatives in some situations. As we get older we have more
                                worries and things happening with our lives than can make learning to drive more stressful. This, in
                                turn, can make the process more difficult.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">Adjusting the being the one who needs to be watchful all the time rather than a
                                passenger gazing out of the wind can also take some adjustment for older learner drivers. This means
                                learning to focus on potential hazards can take a bit more work!</p>
